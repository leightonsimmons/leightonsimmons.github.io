            <b>What Is A Sea Glider?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            With stories of hovercraft and land speeders becoming less fiction and more reality, it was only a matter of
            time before some emerging techonology took the world storm. That is exactly what companies such as Ocean
            Flyer¹ and Wigetworks² are doing. Looking like a hybrid of a plane and boat, Sea Gliders use the hull shape
            of a boat to glide through the water, before taking off with two large wings and gliding over the waters
            surface³.
            <br>
            <br>
            As put by REGENT (one of the leading developers in Sea Glider technology): "The seaglider is a
            wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) vehicle that operates within a wingspan off the water's surface and combines the
            high speed of an airplane with the low operating cost of a boat. Seagliders are different from past WIGs due
            to their hydrofoils, distributed electric propulsion, and aerospace fly by wire controls, which enable safe
            harbor operations, increased wave tolerance, and a comfortable passenger experience.⁴"

            <b>How Is It Powered?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Even after all the research I have done on the wing-in-ground effect, it can still be hard to understand. To
            the best of my knowledge and skills I have tried to condense and simplify it as much as I can.
            <br>
            When a plane is flying through the air, its wings are at a precise angle to create enough lift to stay
            elevated while
            using the least amount of power⁵ (See figure 3 below). This is why when a plane is taking off it
            travels down a long run way to
            gather enough speed for the wings to generate lift.
            <br>
            <br>
            The same principle is used for ground effect vehicles, in particularly Sea Gliders. When a wing travels
            through the air it produces a type of vortex of air that spirals off the tip of the wing. When an aircraft
            is travelling close to the ground or ocean this vortex is compressed from the ground and redirected back
            underneath of the wing generating more lift⁶ (See figure 4 below).
            <br>
            <br>
            This means that a ground effect vehicle can carry greater loads for its weight when compared to an aircraft
            of similar power and weight⁷. It can also use less power as it does not need to use as much power to stay
            aloft. It could even be possible for a sea glider to use an electric motor or power source⁸. This has been
            impossible for commercial airlines as they require a large amount of power to even stay in the air and it
            has seemed incredibly difficult to get a fraction of the amount of power needed from an electric motor.
            <br>
            <br>
            Keep in mind this is a very simplified version and there are dozens of sources out there that explain this
            process in greater depth.

            <b>How Would They Be Used?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The most obvious use for Sea Gliders is public and cargo transportation. Since the ground effect was
            discovered in the 1920s, numerous attempts have been made to create a fully functional and manuverable WIG
            craft⁹.
            <br>
            It was actually the Soviet Union who first discovered the practical applications of the ground effect
            in the 1960s. They created what is now known as the <i>"Caspian Sea Monster"</i>¹⁰ (See figure 5 & 6).
            Although it was primarily
            used for military needs, transporting tanks and heavy missiles, it set the bar for what was possible from
            ground effect vehicles.
            <br>
            <br>
            REGENT and Ocean Flyer now plan to use the Sea Glider technology for commercial transportation. According to
            Ocean Flyer CEO Shahnawaz Aslam: "They are predicted to travel at speeds of up to 540kph.¹¹"
            <br>
            Aslam also said: "At this speed they could travel from Auckland to Whangārei in 30 minutes for $30 or
            Wellington to Lyttelton in an hour for $60 a seat.
            For comparison, Air New Zealand’s turboprop ATR aircraft, which service the airline’s regional routes, have
            a cruising speed of 510kph.¹²"

            <br>
            <br>
            Most new inventions such as electric and hydrogen cars requires hundreds of refuelling stations to be
            effective. Fortunately, this is not the case with Sea Gliders. Due to the fact that they are similar to sea
            planes, they can use existing dock infrastructure and services¹³. For example, if Sea Gliders were to by
            implemented in Auckland, they could use the existing port and wharfs.
            <br>
            <br>
            Because of this shortcut of types, Sea Gliders will be able available much sooner the hydrogen cars
            could be. Ocean Flyer wants to have 25 Sea Gliders fully operational in New Zealand by 2028¹⁴. The first of
            these arriving in 2025.

        <p id="r5" class="r">
            <b>How Much Do They Cost To Manufacture and Operate?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately there have been no exact numbers released. However, Ocean Flyer have released estimates on the
            cost for transportation in Sea Gliders. A trip from Wellington to Christchurch will take only 60 minutes and
            cost $60¹⁵. This price is reflected in other estimates such as Auckland to Waiheke Island in 12 minutes for
            $12¹⁶.
            <br>
            <br>
            For comparison, an average trip across the Cook Strait from Wellington to Picton
            will cost you about $60 for 3 hours and 30 minutes when travelling with Interislader¹⁷ (See figure 7).
            <br>
            <br>
            Sea Glider will also use battery technology similar to that used by TESLA¹⁸. This means that the charge time
            and price is relatively cheap when compared to a fossil fuel car or electric ferry (See Numerical Data for
            full information).

                <b>How Does It Comapare To Other Methods Of Transportation?</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Sea Gliders have a higher power to weight ratio than a typical boat. Meaning that they can produce more
                power per kg/tonne than a regular boat¹⁹. This allows them to be not only extremely useful for public
                transport, but incredibley effective for cargo transportation as they can carry much heavier loads with
                less power and energy²⁰.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you want too see how Sea Gliders compare in efficency and other categories (cost, safety, comfort)
