        <th class="einformation">See numbers in red below (Figure 1) for a typical Panamax container ship that can carry
          up to
          18,000 twenty-foot containers.
          <br>
          <br>
          These ships have a fuel capacity of around 16,000 metric tons and currently a
          metric ton of heavy fuel oil costs $833, so about $13.3 Million to fuel up!!
          <br>
          <br>
          The shipping line charges around $7,500 per container to get from anywhere in the World to NZ. This means for
          one full shipload of containers the total fees charged to the customers would be over $135 Million, so the
          fuel cost is only around 10% of the operating cost to run the ship.
          <br>
          <br>
          For comparison though, keep in mind that the value of all the goods in 18,000 containers on this size ship
          could easily be over $1 Billion once sold in NZ.
          <br>
          <br>
          This type of ship uses around 230 metric tons of heavy fuel per day at 20 knots, so does about 480 nautical
          miles / 890 kms per day and costs $192,000 per day in fuel at this speed.
          On this basis, their fuel tanks should last for 70 days or around 60,000kms range on (in perfect weather).
