                    The world is changing. Throughout history we have either avoided or
                    adapted to these changes. However, the current issues facing our
                    planet can neither be avoided or adapted to. Instead, we have to
                    solve them.
                    <br>
                    One of biggest problem with dozens of proposed solutions is the
                    acceptance from the public.
                    <br>
                    Or, more specifically, the lack of it.

        </div>

        <p>As seen in figure 1, over 40% of Auckland's greenhouse gas emissions are a byproduct of the transportation
            sector.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many would say that this is due to overwhelming population of Auckland (1,652,000²) when compared to a city
            such as Christchurch (402,000³). However, this only further reinforces to need and effectiveness of a
            vehicle such as the Sea Glider.
            <br>
            <br>
            This article will explain to you to ins-and-outs of Sea Glider. As well as the
            incredible technology that is revolutionizing the transportation industry.
